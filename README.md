# About
FSTools contains 7 pie menus and 2 layout menus. Some of the menus are nested within each other and thus they spawn more menus, the goal of FSTools was to take some cumbersome keyboard shortcuts, hidden away UI elements and combine them into a single menu or subset of menus. Development initially began on the 4th January 2018, which pre-dates the official 2.80 release by about a year and 5 months or so.
