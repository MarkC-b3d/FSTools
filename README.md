# FSTools
FSTools is a collection of pie menus to accomodate a fast and efficient workflow in fullscreen.

# About
FSTools contains 7 pie menus and 2 layout menus. Some of the menus are nested within each other and thus they spawn more menus, the goal of FSTools was to take some cumbersome keyboard shortcuts, hidden away UI elements and combine them into a single menu or subset of menus. Development initially began on the 4th January 2018, which pre-dates the official 2.80 release by about a year and 5 months or so.

# Installation
This python script requires the 3D creation suite called blender to run, you can download the latest version here:

Now open blender and go to Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install

# Launching FSTools
When FSTools is installed and ready to be used it can be activated in object or edit mode with ALT + Q.

# Roadmap
There are a lot of features I want to add to FSTools and its currently quite far away from where I want it to be. I open sourced this addon in the hopes that other developers would contribute code and make it even greater. It takes time to make great addons and copious amounts of coffee. The following is just some things on my mind for FSTools to have.

I want to move FSTools to v0.2 by December 2019.

November 2019 will continue to be small additions, code cleanup along with code compliance audit and review.

- [ ] An FSTools menu for riggers / animators to use.
- [ ] Render presets menu.
- [ ] Preferences menu for users to toggle between pie menus and layout menu operators.
- [ ] Writing a wiki on github.
- [ ] Operators for optimising shaders like glass.
